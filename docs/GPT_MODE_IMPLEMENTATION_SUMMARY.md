# GPT Mode Personalization Implementation

## Completed Tasks

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Created SQL migration to add `gpt_mode_enabled` column to auth.users table
   - Added synchronization with profiles table (if it exists)
   - Set up appropriate triggers for keeping tables in sync

2. **Security Implementation**
   - Created Row Level Security (RLS) policies for auth.users table
   - Ensured users can only update their own GPT mode setting
   - Set up policies for profiles table as well

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Enhanced EnhancedChatInterface to check for user authentication
   - Added debounced updates to prevent excessive API calls
   - Implemented fallback to localStorage for anonymous users
   - Added proper error handling for failed API calls

4. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation in docs/GPT_MODE_PERSONALIZATION.md
   - Updated README.md to include the new feature
   - Added implementation details and usage examples

5. **Migration Scripts**
   - Created migrate-gpt-mode.sh script to apply database changes
   - Added proper error handling and informative output

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test saving GPT mode for logged-in users
   - Verify fallback to localStorage for anonymous users
   - Confirm debouncing works correctly
   - Test error handling scenarios

2. **UI Enhancements**
   - Consider adding visual feedback when mode is saved
   - Add tooltip explaining what each mode does
   - Consider moving the toggle to a more intuitive location

3. **Analytics**
   - Track GPT mode usage to understand user preferences
   - Analyze response satisfaction based on mode

## Running the Migration

To apply the database changes, run:

```bash
export SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
./scripts/migrate-gpt-mode.sh
```

## Additional Notes

- The implementation is backward compatible with existing behavior
- Anonymous users still have their preferences saved locally
- The feature degrades gracefully if Supabase API calls fail
- Debouncing prevents API rate limiting and improves performance
