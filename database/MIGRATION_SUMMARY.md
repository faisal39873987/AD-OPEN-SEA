# AD PLUS Assistant - Supabase Database Migration Summary

## Overview
This document provides a summary of the database migration process for setting up the AD PLUS Assistant application's database tables in Supabase.

## Migration Process

### 1. Database Structure
We've created three main tables:

- **services**: Stores information about service providers in different categories
- **user_requests**: Records chat history between users and the assistant
- **user_feedback**: Stores user ratings and feedback for services

### 2. Migration Files
The following files have been prepared to help with the migration:

- `/database/supabase_migration.sql`: The main SQL script to create tables and insert sample data
- `/database/verify_migration.sql`: SQL script to verify the migration was successful
- `/scripts/migrate-supabase.sh`: Shell script that provides migration instructions

### 3. Manual Migration Steps
To complete the database migration:

1. Log in to the Supabase Dashboard at https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project (URL: https://cceuyhebxxqafmrmnqhq.supabase.co)
3. Go to SQL Editor and create a new query
4. Copy the entire contents of `/database/supabase_migration.sql` into the editor
5. Click "Run" to execute the SQL
6. To verify, run the SQL from `/database/verify_migration.sql`

### 4. Expected Results
After successful migration:

- Old tables (`messages`, `subscription`, `schema_migrations`) should be deleted
- New tables (`services`, `user_requests`, `user_feedback`) should be created
- `services` table should contain 8 sample records
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies should be applied to all tables

## Integration with Application
The application is now configured to work with these tables through:

1. `/src/lib/types/database.ts`: TypeScript definitions for database tables
2. `/src/lib/services/servicesAPI.ts`: API service for database operations
3. `/src/lib/services/chatService.ts`: Chat service that combines database and GPT

## Next Steps
1. Run the migration in your Supabase instance
2. Verify the tables were created correctly
3. Ensure your application environment variables are set correctly to connect to Supabase
4. Test the application's database functionality

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
- Check the Supabase SQL Editor for error messages
- Ensure you have the correct permissions in your Supabase project
- Verify the SQL syntax in the migration file
- Check that all required extensions (like uuid-ossp) are enabled
