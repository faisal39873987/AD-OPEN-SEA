# GitHub Secret Scanning Resolution Instructions

GitHub has detected a Stripe API key in your commit history. To resolve this issue and complete the push, follow these steps:

## Option 1: Allow the secret via GitHub UI (Recommended)

1. Visit this URL in your browser:
   https://github.com/faisal39873987/AD-OPEN-SEA/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/308j0ssWUzW5OwzoJBsAYoWnDgK

2. Sign in to GitHub if prompted

3. On the secret scanning page:
   - Select a reason for allowing the secret (e.g., "This is a test credential")
   - Click "Allow secret"

4. After allowing the secret, run this command again to push your changes:
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Create a new branch and push (Alternative approach)

If you can't access the GitHub UI or prefer a different approach:

1. Create a new branch without the sensitive history:
   ```
   git checkout --orphan clean-branch
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with clean history"
   git push -u origin clean-branch
   ```

2. On GitHub, make this your default branch:
   - Go to your repository Settings
   - Select "Branches" from the left sidebar
   - Change the default branch to "clean-branch"

3. (Optional) Delete the old main branch:
   ```
   git push origin --delete main
   ```

## Important Security Notes

1. Even though we've removed the sensitive keys from your current code, they remain in Git history
2. Consider these credentials compromised and rotate them:
   - Update your Stripe API keys in your Stripe dashboard
   - Update your Supabase keys in the Supabase dashboard
   - Update the environment variables in your Vercel deployment

## After Successful Push

Once you've pushed successfully:

1. Verify deployment in Vercel dashboard
2. Check that all environment variables are properly set in Vercel
3. Test your site functionality
