feat: implement GPT-Supabase Intelligent Assistant

This commit implements the GPT-Supabase Intelligent Assistant with a smart router
that searches Supabase for service data first and falls back to GPT when no
relevant services are found.

Key changes:
- Created Supabase API layer for service data access
- Implemented smart router between Supabase and OpenAI
- Updated chat API to use the smart router
- Added chat session management and history storage
- Created database verification and sample data scripts
- Added deployment automation for adplus.app
- Updated documentation with implementation details

The implementation follows the 4-phase plan:
1. Supabase API Layer
2. Smart Router
3. Chat Interface Update
4. Deployment System

This completes the final phase of the AD Pulse project.
